Use the rsync plugin to deploy files to a server using rsync over ssh. The following parameters are used to configure this plugin:

* `user` - connects as this user
* `host` - connects to this host address
* `port` - connects to this host port
* `source` - source path from which files are copied
* `target` - target path to which files are copied
* `delete` - delete extraneous files from the target dir
* `recursive` - recursively transfer all files
* `exclude` - exclude files matching the specified pattern
* `commands` - execute commands on the remote host after files are copied

Sample configuration in the `.drone.yml` file:

```yaml
deploy:
  rsync:
    user: root
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 22
    source: copy/files/from
    target: send/files/to
    delete: false
    recursive: true
    commands:
      - service nginx restart
```

## Keys

The plugin authenticates to your server using a per-repository SSH key generated by Drone. You can find the public key in your repository settings in Drone. You will need to copy / paste this key into your `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on your remote machine.
